Puppet:

modules:
Install modules from Puppet Forge
Installed modules are found in the modulepath: /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules.
(Modules are synonymous with cookbooks in Chef)

Node groups:
Nodes are individual instances or servers that the Puppet agent runs on.  It can automatically query for updates from
the Catalog in Puppet Master.

Puppet Master:
This is where all the puppet code lives (i.e. chef server)

Puppet Agent:
Agent that runs on an individual instance/server.
puppet agent --mytest

Resources:

Resource Abstraction Layer (RAL)
-users, files, services, packages are Resource Units

Puppet's Domain Specific Language (DSL)
-A block of code that describes a resource declaration is written the Puppet DSL.
-Puppet DSL is declarative and only describe the desired end state. Providers will handle the implementation.
-Puppet can inspect the current state of any existing resource in the same syntax you would declare the state (unlike
chef which has the issue when it converges, the state cannot always be inspected).

Built-in Resource Types:
>puppet describe --list
i.e.
-user A user
-group A user group
-file A specific file
-package A software package
You can get a list of parameters from any resource:
>puppet describe user | less

Resources are defined as list of Hashes (hence the =>)
type {'title':
    attribute => 'value',
}


Puppet Apply tool
>puppet apply -e
The -e flag will limit the apply to one-off changes.
i.e.
puppet apply -e "user { 'galatea': ensure => present, }"

Edit a Specific Resource:
puppet resource -e myresource
>puppet resource -e user galatea
