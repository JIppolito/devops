	Max Timeout in minutes <br />
	This field sets how long the job will wait while the instance builds.<br />
	It is possible if the timeout is short and the instance takes longer than the timeout to build, then the instance would be built 
	successfully even though the job fails.  Please check kitchen and aws to ensure that you instance was created successfully.
