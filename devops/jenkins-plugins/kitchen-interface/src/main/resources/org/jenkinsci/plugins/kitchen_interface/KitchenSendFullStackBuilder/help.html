<p>This plugin will send a full stack build request to Kitchen and poll kitchen every 10 seconds for a response. If the response from kitchen is FAILED, but it still returns an 
IP Address then the plugin will change the build status to UNSTABLE. <br />
The plugin will only label the build as FAILURE when: <br />
<ul>
<li>Kitchen status response states that the build failed AND there is no IP Address associated OR there is no DNS Entry associated </li>
with the build. 
<li>Kitchen status response fails to return an instance id </li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>All of the Inputs for this plugin must be a valid Parameterized String in the format <i>$variable_name</i> or <i>${variable_name}</i>, else it will treat the input as a string.<br />
It will NOT parse a combination of parameterized values and strings (i.e. <i>$role_SomePlainText_$BUILD_NUMBER</i>)</p>

Sample HTTP Post Parameters String that is sent to kitchen from this plugin:<br>
